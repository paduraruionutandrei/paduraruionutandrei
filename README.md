## Hi there 👾

I'm Ionut, a Software Engineer based in Romania.

Outside of work, I'm fully dedicated to improving my knowledge in the tech world.

My future plans include enhancing my expertise and becoming a great software architect.

When I'm not programming, I love playing football, video games, and traveling. 🐿️

👨‍💻 I am currently working on improving my Vanilla JS skills.
